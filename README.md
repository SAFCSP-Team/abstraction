**Problem**

Create  a `Vehicle` class using the abstraction concept.

**Implementation**

* Create a `Vehicle` abstract class. With `name` and `brand` attributes and `start()` as an abstract method.
* Create a class called `Car` that extends the `Vehicle` abstract class.
* Implement the `start()` method in the `car` class. To print the car's name.
* In the main method, Create an object from the `Car` class, and call the `start()` method.

```Java

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
          /* your code here */
   }
}


```
