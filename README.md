**Problem**

Create an abstract class named `Vehicle`, then create the following classes `Car` & `Track` which they shared the following attributes `name `& `brand` and methods `start()` &  `stop()`.

**Implementation**
* Create `Vehicle` abstract class.
* Create the following classes `Car`, `Track` that inherit from `Vhecile`
* `start()` is abstract method.
* Change the implement of the `start()` method for each class, it should print the name of the veicle.
* Create an object from each class and call them in the main method.

```Java

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

   }
}


```
